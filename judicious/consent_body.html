<p>You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide to participate in this study, it is
    important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take the time
    to read the following information carefully. Please ask the researcher if there is anything that is not
    clear or if you need more information.</p>

<p>This research project concerns psychological processes. The experiment will ask you to answer simple
    questions and/or perform simple tasks by interacting with a Web survey. Your data will be pooled with those
    of others, and your responses will be completely anonymous. However, we will keep the data obtained for all
    participants for possible use in other scientific publications. </p>
<p>
    We expect that this experiment will take only about <strong>10 minutes</strong> and carries no foreseeable
    risks and/or
    benefits beyond any compensation that you may receive and the knowledge that you are helping to improve our
    knowledge of human psychology.</p>

<p>
    Due to the nature of psychology experiments, we cannot explain the precise purpose of the experiment until
    after the session is over, but you will be asked to make judgements or decisions about what you see as part
    of this study. You will be given more specific instructions as you go about the tasks.</p>

<p>
    Afterwards, the experimenter will be happy to answer any questions you might have about the procedure. You
    will receive the reward specified on the Mechanical-Turk HIT for participating. Your participation is
    completely voluntary. You are free to decline to participate or to end participation at any time for any
    reason without penalty. </p>

<p>
    <u>
        <strong> Confidentiality:</strong>
    </u>
    <br> All records from this study will be kept confidential. The study data will be kept in a coded manner
    (separate from your name) until the end of the study. At that time your name or other identifiable data will
    no longer be connected to any of the study data. Research records will be stored securely in a locked
    cabinet and/or on password-protected computers. The research team will be the only party that will have
    access to your data.
    <p>
        <u>
            <strong>Compensation:</strong>
        </u>
        <br> You will be paid $1.00 for 10 minutes of participation.
